### Power Signal
It has finite power and infinite energy.

### Energy Signal
It has finite energy and infinite power.

`Note`
-Signals having both `infinite energy` and `infinite power` are neither energy nor power signal.
-Both energy and power signals are mutually exclusive, i.e., `no signal can be both` power signal and energy signal.
