## Fourier TRansform
is a mathematical transform that decomposes functions depending on space or time into functions depending on `spatial frequency` or `temporal frequency`


**Fourier Transform can exist for - **
- Energy signal (Absolutly intigrable)
- Power signal (Not Absolutly intigrable)
- Impulse signal related signal (But donot exist for Neither energy nor power signal).It is an exception of NENP because it is an absolutely intigratable signal.
