|Programming Laptop|ML Laptop
|--|--
| 16 GB RAM (8 GB is too ok)|32 GB RAM
|I5 |I7
|256 GB SSD|256 GB SSD(Storage dosen't mater at this point)
|No graphics card required|8 GB (Put Graphics card as required)
||BUY a laptop by only gpu value $\geqslant$ 8GB </br>(It will be better to build a pc with alot research)

#### PC Build Calculation </br>[ML RIG](https://youtu.be/Utwnm2kjYAM)
| Item |Product| Price | Requirment
|--|--|--|--
|Motherboard||14K|Keep it upgradable check for the number of:</br>DIMM slots for RAM,</br>PCIe slots for GPUs,</br>M2 slots for NVMe SSDs (if you’ll be using anytime soon),</br>SATA ports for SSDs,</br>Thunderbolt 3/USB 3.0/2.0 as per need.
|Processor||12K|No much use in DL
|GPU|12GB|60K| The most Important ,Connecting 2 GPUs together ideally should give 2x the performance, but you end up getting only an additional 40% bump for most of the cases than using a single GPU. This not only draws more power, leading to higher electricity bills but heating issues make the matter worse. 
|RAM|32GB|12K|RAM clock speed doesn't matter, the ammount matters
|SSD|240GB|3K|For fast loading ,data will be residing in RAM or GPU VRAM. Storage doesn’t matter while you are training data.
|HDD|1TB|3K|for long term storage
|Coller||3K| cool the cpu
|Frame||6K
|Keyboard (May be keyboard with touch pad)||2K
|Mouse
|Display|Benq|13K
||Total |150k
- Today here by i conclude that pc build is cheaper laptop wort 150K is not that much valuable.
- Make some `models` on your  laptop watch ML Rig.
- Power supply unit = (all cpu watts + all gpu watts)* 100%
