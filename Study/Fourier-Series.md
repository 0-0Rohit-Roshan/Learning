**Finding Coefficient of fourier series**

$$ f(x)  = a_0 + \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n cos(nx \frac{\pi}{L}) \right) + \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty b_n sin(nx \frac{\pi}{L}) \right) $$

-f(x) is the function we want (such as a square wave)
-L is half of the period of the function
-a0, an and bn are coefficients that we need to calculate!
