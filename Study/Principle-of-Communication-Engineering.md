### Continuos Wave Modulation
- The Objective of modulation is to shift the base band to the frequency range suitable for Transmission .
-  Shifting a range of frequency is achived by modulation.
- `Modulation` -  The process by which carachteristic of a carrier signal is changed in acordance to message signal.
- `Demodulation` - Resotring the passband signal to baseband signal .
- The Modulatron is the core of the transmitter and the Demodulation is the core of the reciver.
- `Q.` [Why only sinusuidal signal as carrier in modulation ?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-sinusoidal-signals-used-as-carriers-in-modulation-technique)  
`A.`  To avoid aliasing and bandwidth congestion we use sinusoidal waves for modulation techniques.

## Amplitude Modulation
- Carrier Signal $C(t) = A_c Cos(2 \pi f_c t)$  
$A_c$ Carrier Amplitude | $f_c$ Carrier Frequency  
- Message Signal $m(t)$
- Amplitude of the Carrier is varied  about a mean value , linearly with $m(t)$. 
- 

**Linear Modulation Technique**
- $S(t) = A_c (1+K_a m(t)) Cos(2 \pi f_c t)$  
$K_a$ = Amplitude Sensitivity $[Volt^{-1}]$ 

$K_a m(t) > 1$|$K_a m(t) < 1$
--|--
Overmodulated|
Phase Revarsal|
Envlop Distortion|Modulation % </br> $K_a m(t) x 100 < 100$ </br> avoid Envlope distortion.
- For satisfactory envlop detection $f_c >> \omega_{message}$

**Spectrum of AM Signal**
- Spectrum of AM signal $S(t)$ is $S(f)$
- $$S(f) = \frac{A_c}{2} [] + \frac{K_a A_c}{2} []$$
- AM Spectrum 
    - Two Delta function at $\pm f_c$
    - Two .... baseband at $\pm f_c$

```Note```
- $f_c < \omega$ lower & upper side band at $-f_c$ and $+f_c$ will overlap and reasult in message distortion.
- Baseband bandwidth $\omega$  
Passband `Transmissionband` bandwidth $2 \omega$

**Singleton Modulation**
- $m(t) = A_m Cos(2 \pi f_m t)$  
$S(t) = A_c[1 +  \mu Cos(2 \pi f_m t)]Cos(2 \pi f_c t) $  
$\mu = K_a A_m$
- $S(t) = ?$  
$S(f) = ?$
```
Note
```
- Carrier Power - $\frac{1}{2} A_c^2$
- Upper Side frequency power - $\frac{1}{8} \mu^2 A_c^2$
- Lower Side frequency power - $\frac{1}{8} \mu^2 A_c^2$
- Total Power in Modulated wave - $[\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}\mu^2]A_c^2$
- Total power in side band (message part) = $\frac{1}{4} \mu^2 A_c^2$  
- Power efficiency = $\frac{Total power in Side Band}{Total Power in Modulated Wave}$ =  $\frac{\mu^2}{2+\mu^2}$  
For $\mu = 1$ power efficiency is 33% .

**Demodulation of AM Signal**
- **Envlop Detector**

- Design Requirments
    - Charging time constant must be shorter than carrier period,$$(r_s + R_f)C<<\frac{1}{f_c}$$
    - Discharging time constant must be larger compared to period of carrier wave , $$R_RC>> \frac{1}{f_c}$$
    - Discharging time constant must be smaller than period of modulating message signal, $$R_RC << \frac{1}{\omega}$$

- AM modulation wastes power in carrier transmission. One band, either lower or upper band can be used
- wasting bandwidth by useing both upper side band & lower side band.
- Above disadvantages can be overcomed by
    - Double sideband supressed carrier
    - Single sideband carrier
    - Vastigial sideband

**Generation of SSB Signal**  
[**Phase Shifter Method**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6IBERQFP3s)  
**Detection of SSB Signal With a Carrier**
- $$\phi_{SSB+C} = A_c Cos(2 \pi f_ct) + [m(t)Cos(2 \pi f_ct)+m_h(t)Sin(2 \pi f_ct)]$$
- If the carrier signal can be extracted by narrow-band-filtering of $\phi_{SSB+C}$ then $m(t)$ can be recovered by `Coherrent detection` .
- Alternatively if the carrier amplitude is large envlope then also $m(t)$ can be recovered using `envelop detection` .
- $$\phi_{SSB+C} = [A_c + m(t)] Cos(2 \pi f_ct)+m_h(t)Sin(2 \pi f_c t)$$
$$=E(t) Cos(e \pi f_c t + \theta)$$
- Where $$E(t) = [[A_c + m(t)]^2 + m_h^2(t)]^\frac{1}{2}$$
