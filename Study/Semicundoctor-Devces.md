`1)`   
`a) Draw the Energy Band diagram for a p-n junction.`

`b) Define n-type and p-type semiconductors.`  
The majority carriers in a p-type semiconductor are holes.   
In an n-type semiconductor is is electron.

`c) What are the properties of a good acceptor atom?`  
Acceptor atoms have unfiled outer orbital .


 `d) State the Law of Mass Action.`  
 For extrinsic semiconductor the law of mass action states that the product of majority carriers and minority carriers is constant at fixed temperature and is independent of amount of donor and acceptor impurity added.

`e) What is the difference between mobility and conductivity?`  
Conductivity is proportional to the product of mobility and carrier concentration.

`f) What is effective mass?`  
The effective mass is a quantity that is used to simplify band structures by modeling the behavior of a free particle with that mass. For some purposes and some materials, the effective mass can be considered to be a simple constant of a material.

`g) What is the relation between the built-in potential and the width of the junction? `  
Qualitatively, the depletion region width increases with the poling voltage and decreases with the concentration of mobile ions.

`h) What are drift and diffusion currents?`  
Drift current is the current flow in the diode due to the applied electric field.   
Diffusion current is the current due to the diffusion of the carriers because of the change in the carrier concentration.

`i) For a given semiconductor the electron mobility (𝝁𝒏) is generally higher than hole mobility (𝝁𝒑). Why?`  
Effective mass of electrons is less than that of holes hence electrons have higher mobility than holes.

`j) Why the built-in potential (Vbi) of a p-n junction is not measurable by Voltmeter?`  
We cannot measure the potential barrier across p-n junction by voltmeter because the voltmeter must have a resistance very high compared to the junction resistance, the latter being nearly infinite.

`a) Proof that the concentration of holes in a p-type semiconductor is equal to the concentration of acceptor atoms (assume NA>>ND).`
