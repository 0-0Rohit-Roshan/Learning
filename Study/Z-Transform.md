###### Mathematical 
- Used to solve `differential` and `discrit sequence` .
- The Z-Transform of a sequence $u_n$ denoted as $Z(u_n)$ is defined as $$Z(un) = \sum_{n=\infty}^{\infty} u_n Z^{-n} = \overline{u(z)} $$ Where $\overline{u(z)}$ is a Complex no. . 
- Z-Transform exists only when the infinity series in the above formula is convergent. 
-  The Sequence $u_n$ is called the inverse Z-Transform of $\overline{u(z)}$ & is written as $Z^{-1}[\overline{u(z)}] = u_n$ .
